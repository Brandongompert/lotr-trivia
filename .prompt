You are a senior frontend engineer creating a minimal, production-ready starter
for a fan-made movie trivia website.

CONTEXT

- The project is a Vite + React + TypeScript app
- The scaffolding already exists (do NOT recreate Vite, React, or TS)
- The app will be hosted as a static site behind Nginx in Docker
- No backend or database is required
- Trivia data will live in static JSON files
- The UI should feel like animated flashcards (smooth, modern, simple)
- Cost and complexity must be kept as low as possible

TECH CONSTRAINTS

- Use React with functional components and hooks only
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- No Redux, no React Query, no unnecessary libraries
- No authentication
- No environment variables
- Everything must work fully client-side

WHAT TO BUILD
Create a clean starter implementation that includes:

1. A basic application layout
2. A flashcard-style trivia experience
3. Static trivia data loading from JSON
4. Simple animation (card flip or slide)
5. Keyboard and click navigation
6. A clear, unofficial fan-site disclaimer component

PROJECT STRUCTURE (recommended)

- src/
  - components/
    - TriviaCard.tsx
    - TriviaDeck.tsx
    - ProgressBar.tsx
    - Disclaimer.tsx
  - data/
    - trivia.sample.json
  - hooks/
    - useTrivia.ts
  - types/
    - trivia.ts
  - styles/
    - index.css (Tailwind entry)
  - App.tsx
  - main.tsx

FEATURE DETAILS

- TriviaCard:
  - Shows question on front
  - Reveals answer on click
  - Animates flip or slide using Framer Motion
- TriviaDeck:
  - Manages question order and progress
  - Next/Previous navigation
- ProgressBar:
  - Shows progress through the deck
- Data:
  - Load from a static JSON file via import
- State:
  - Use React state only
  - Persist progress optionally using localStorage
- Accessibility:
  - Keyboard navigation (left/right or space)
  - Buttons must be focusable

DO NOT:

- Add backend code
- Add server logic
- Add tests
- Add analytics
- Add authentication
- Overengineer

DELIVERABLES

- Implement the components listed above
- Provide clean, commented TypeScript code
- Ensure the app runs with `npm run dev`
- Ensure the app builds with `npm run build`
- Include a short README section explaining the structure and how to add new trivia

STYLE & UX

- Minimal, clean, readable
- Card-based layout
- Subtle animations (no gimmicks)
- Neutral colors (Tailwind defaults are fine)

IMPORTANT
Only modify or add files inside `src/`
Do NOT modify package.json scripts
Assume dependencies will be installed manually

END GOAL
A simple but polished trivia MVP that feels good to use,
is legally cautious, and is easy to extend later.
